## Part 1 : The Fundamentals of Machine Learning
<p align="justify">

**Machine Learning** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coded rules, Machine Learning models identify patterns in data and use them to make predictions or decisions.
